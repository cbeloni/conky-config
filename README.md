# conky-config
This project is an example of a conky config uncluding system logs, cpu, ram, disk io and network monitoring. It also show weather and a simple calendar. The display is half english and french for some elements. This configuration is inspired from mtking2 / conky-config but shows how to implement accuweather scripts.
